# Highway-Networks-and-Traffic-Simulations-in-TRANSIMS
This is a tutorial for using TRANSIMS and QGIS in the case of Traffic simulation. I came across TRANSIMS while studying mathematical models,
specifically random walks and social simulations. TRANSIMS is an excellent Traffic and Network simulator where you can create network models
and generate simulated traffic on it to test your networks. The documentation on TRANSIMS can be found at
https://code.google.com/archive/p/transims/ although a lot of the documentation is broken. The tutorial covers intallation, explains some 
of the concepts of the software and takes you through a sample simulation along with looking at GIS tools like QGIS and ArcGIS.
The Abstract of the tutorial:

Abstract

Advancements in technology and modern computers mean we can now simulate and analyze complex sociotechnical systems with hundreds of variable factors on our local computers. One such software currently in development, which can create and simulate such systems is TRANSIMS. The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS), is an integrated set of tools developed to conduct regional transportation system analyses. It uses a new paradigm of modeling individual travelers and their multi-modal transportation based on synthetic populations and their activities. Compared to other transportation aggregate models, TRANSIMS represents time consistently and continuously, as well as detailed persons and households. This paper focuses on the Installation and execution of TRANSIMS simulations, and in turn, explores the different data and control files required, the global keys and parameters of TRANSIMS, and the results they generate. This paper also goes on to study how to effectively visualize these results using a GIS software and investigates some of the capabilities of such software's.
